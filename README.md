# Book Hero #

Book Hero is a web reading application with some social elements. Users can search for books to add to their personal library, available to be read at any time. They can also self-publish their own stories, which others will be able to read. Finally, users can comment, and view each others comments, for any given chapter in any book.

This repository contains the React / Redux frontend for Book Hero.
